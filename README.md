# SMS-Spam-Filter-
Python 


This was my final project for  Cpt_S 315 Intro To Data Mining.


In this project, we use text mining to perform automatic spam filtering to use SMS effectively. We try to identify patterns using Data-mining classification algorithms to enable us to classify the SMS as HAM or SPAM.
